            <p class="featureParagraph">A small device is installed covertly into the vehicle. This device acquires GPS satellites to get its position, speed and heading. Positions are customarily recorded every 1 minute of travel. The device also collect and report on other events like vehicle ignition, Idling, starts, stops, heavy acceleration, deceleration, harsh cornering, large G forces (a collision) and tilt (towing) just to name a few.  The device can also be configured to relay things like a door opening or an auxiliary switch (e.g. a PTO) turning on and off. All of this data is collected by the device and forwarded over the air via data cellular networks to our data centers. There the data is processed and presented on-line via EasiTrack's Web applications.</p>

            <p class="featureParagraph">The Web based application allows you to login from any internet connected device. This is where you will see the data processed into things like real-time and historical locations of vehicles along with a myriad of reports and alerts of the data collected by the device(s). Being web based means that there is no special software to download. Mapping updates, feature enhancements and all other upgrades are automatic and seamless.</p>
