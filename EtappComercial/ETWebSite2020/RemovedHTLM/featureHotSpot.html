            <p class="featureParagraph"><strong>HotSpots</strong> are places where your drivers go with a certain frequency, that are not created as geofences.  With <strong>HotSpots</strong> you can pin-point any place that is being visited by your drivers with or without your knowledge. HotSpots is based on a very complex analytical algorithm that extracts <strong>intelligent data</strong> from the behavior of your fleet, to give you an <strong>insight</strong> that otherwise would be nearly impossible to acquire.</p>

            <p class="featureParagraph">With EasiTrack, you can find out whether your drivers are doing side jobs or not.  EasiTrack's intelligent analytical engine is continuously running through the data sent
            by each one of your devices, minute by minute, and correlating stops and frequencies, to identify patterns of recurrent stops.  Some times these stops are side-jobs.</p>

            <p class="featureParagraph">With the Hot Spots Module, you can rank the locations most frequently visited by your drivers to uncover unknown places and activity worth tracking with 
            Geofences. This allows you to discover the top locations your drivers go to, identify them as Geofences and track your fleet's activity around them.</p>
