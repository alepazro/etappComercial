            <p class="featureParagraph">With EasiTrack, you can review the route followed by any of your vehicles, at any given time.  Just select the vehicle, enter the timeframe, and execute the query.
               In seconds, you will see, in the map, the entire circuit of your vehicle, step by step.  With this capability it is very easy to spot inefficiencies and even inconsistencies, like vehicles that go
               out of their expected route.</p>
