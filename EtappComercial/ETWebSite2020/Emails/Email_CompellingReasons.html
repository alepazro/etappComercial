                <p>Dear #?CONTACT0FIRSTNAME?#,</p>
                <p>Right now you are probably looking for the ideal GPS Tracking vendor for your company.</p>
                <p>The truth is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-size:14px;font-weight:600;">Nowadays, most GPS Tracking companies offer pretty much the same thing</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Which one to pick, then? I would like to give you 6 compelling reasons to consider EasiTrack very seriously:</p>
                <ul style="padding:0px;margin:20px;">
                    <li style="padding:5px;">
                        <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:600;color:#ff0000;">Reason #1: </span><span style="font-weight:600;">Our system does what it promises to do: Tracks your vehicles 24/7</span>
                        <p>"...the system is working great I must say since I have fired the driver that was stealing I don’t watch as closely but it is a great system and we are about ready to go to court on this matter and the system will play a large part in getting a conviction.  I recommend it to any one that is looking for something similar.  Thanks, Kevin"</p>
                        <p>"...I must say that I am still very impressed with the easitrack system. It's been great being able to see every truck in our fleet that I have tagged so far. I'm also impressed with how accurate each location is, down to 5 feet in most cases."</p>
                        <p>"...Thanks to you and all at Easitrack for being there for us.  Your system is awesome.  At times we have 9 trucks out delivering LIVE crawfish and, having your system, has been incredible in allowing us to keep accurate track of the deliveries.  Before EASITRACK we were having to "cell phone" communicate with our drivers in order to let our customers know where our trucks were and WHEN they would arrive.  Hey, no more of that.  My boss can't wait for the next addition to the system so what we can keep accurate track of oil changes, etc. Again thanks for all the support you and your team gave us. Clay"</p>

Dear #?CONTACT0FIRSTNAME?#,

Right now you are probably looking for the ideal GPS Tracking vendor for your company.

The truth is:

    Nowadays, most GPS Tracking companies offer pretty much the same thing

Which one to pick, then? I would like to give you 6 compelling reasons to consider EasiTrack very seriously:

Reason #1: Our system does what it promises to do: Tracks your vehicles 24/7
    "...the system is working great I must say since I have fired the driver that was stealing I don’t watch as closely but it is a great system and we are about ready to go to court on this matter and the system will play a large part in getting a conviction.  I recommend it to any one that is looking for something similar.  Thanks, Kevin"
    "...I must say that I am still very impressed with the easitrack system. It's been great being able to see every truck in our fleet that I have tagged so far. I'm also impressed with how accurate each location is, down to 5 feet in most cases."
    "...Thanks to you and all at Easitrack for being there for us.  Your system is awesome.  At times we have 9 trucks out delivering LIVE crawfish and, having your system, has been incredible in allowing us to keep accurate track of the deliveries.  Before EASITRACK we were having to "cell phone" communicate with our drivers in order to let our customers know where our trucks were and WHEN they would arrive.  Hey, no more of that.  My boss can't wait for the next addition to the system so what we can keep accurate track of oil changes, etc. Again thanks for all the support you and your team gave us. Clay"

Reason #2: Our system is very easy to learn and use.
