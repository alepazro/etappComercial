    <h2>ALERT: Device moving while Ignition is OFF</h2>
    <p>
        Our monitoring system has detected that the device [DEVICE0NAME] is moving while the Ignition is OFF.  Date of event:  [EVENT0DATE].  
        This might be expected in certain cases, for example if the vehicle is being repaired.
    </p>
    <p> 
        If there is no known reason why the GPS Tracker is moving while Ignition is OFF please contact Technical Support at your earliest convenience.  
    </p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
